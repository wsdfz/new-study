# New way to study

---Assumption---
Study has 3 parts: 
	a. Collect message, example: search in google, read book, listen from teacher in classroom;
	b. Organize, example: summarize from story, summarize from teacher;
	c. Train, example: do homework;

And there is a way to combine them together in one scenario with stories which is working in lots of games.


---Implementation---
Present a story with HTML or APP in PC/Smart Phone/Tablet;
At first, we will do it with HTML. Then extend to APP if necessorily.


---Process Overview---
Develop: Organize code from github etc. Based on js. (node.js, angular.js)
	1. Design login (-)
	2. Design knowledge walls (-)
	3. Design the story of each wall (-)

Custom:

	2. Select knowledge wall
	3. Break the wall by passing story
